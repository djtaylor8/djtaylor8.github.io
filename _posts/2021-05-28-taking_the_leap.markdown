We all encounter opportunities to take a leap at some point in our lives. Perhaps it is at a time when we least expect it, but hopefully these moments will come at a time when change is actually needed. The universe has a wonderful way of taking care of us. Feel free to attribute it to a higher power or energy. Whatever it is, answering the call to try something new is both exhilirating and terrifying. So where am I in this cosmic drama, this opportunity to redefine myself and take a leap into the world of software engineering?

Let's set the stage. In the wake of 2020, it's safe to say that many of us confronted an unfathomable amount of change, fear, upheaval, and distress. Checking the news notifications in the morning was enough to trigger a panic attack almost daily with everything happening in the world. At home, in our personal lives, we learned what it meant to develop entirely new routines, separated from our friends, our families, and our coworkers. As a music teacher at a private school, I got an unexepected taste of working from home with a virtual classroom full of children on Zoom wondering what was going to happen next. Even before the craziness of 2020, I had a felt a strong urge to start something new, but was not sure what to do. Music and teaching run deep for me personally and my family - they are tied into my identity. Over the last year, the silver lining, at least for me, was the ample amount of both time and space that I had to get in tune with my instincts and figure out exactly what I wanted my future to look like.

My journey into the world of tech, and more specifically programming languages, was actually initiated through music. As I was planning for the start of the school year online, I wanted to branch out and find ways to teach music in innovative ways. One platform I found was called [Earsketch](https://earsketch.gatech.edu/landing/#/), which was developed by a team at Georgia Tech University. Basically, the online platform is a Digital Audio Workstation (DAW), similar to something like Garageband, that operates through either Javascript or Python. Of course I had heard of these languages, but I didn't know the power they held. Earsketch does a wonderful job of teaching these langauges, as well as other basic computer science concepts, while also diving deep into a variety of musical concepts. I was really excited to learn more and share this with my students in class. Once I started learning the basics, I found myself both fascinated and curious, so I looked up other resources online, only to find an enormous community of aspiring programmers and a variety of content to immerse myself in and continue learning. I was hooked. I didn't know much, but even writing a simple program that said "Hello, World" was enough to get me eager to do more and more. 

This in itself isn't necessarily a leap, but it certainly involved taking steps in a new direction. My decision to really go in was actually inspired by a powerful book I read recently called [Homo Deus](https://www.ynharari.com/book/homo-deus/) by Yuval Noah Harari. The premise of the book focuses on what the future of the human species will look like as we progress in the 21st century and beyond. Homo Deus, as the name implies, speaks to the elevation and evolution of the human species through data science in combination with biotechnology.  Going further, Harari notes specifically that things like data, algorithms, and speaking the languages of computers will only become more crucial as humans rely on these technologies. To think of our own behavior as something that could be broken down into a data structure, or predicted by an algorithm, is not the most comforting feeling in the world, but it is certainly an interesting persective to take. As I was learning more about the basics of programming, this felt like a timely message for me to keep learning so I can equip myself with the tools to enact meaningful change through coding moving forward. I took this to heart, and doubled down on my efforts to absorb as much as I could.

So that brings me here, to the very beginning of my journey with the Flatiron School. I suppose the idiom of "taking a leap" actually makes taking a risk seem scarier than it actually is. This is a new path, sure, but it is not about abandoning who I am and everything I've done up to this point in my life. Rather, it is an exhilirating detour to a new world of building, creating, and problem solving, and I could not be more eager to see what comes next. The possibilites that are out there with the powerful tools and concepts of programming and software engineering are only starting to be revealed to me, and I cannot wait to find new ways to wield that power and resourcefulness in exciting ways.
